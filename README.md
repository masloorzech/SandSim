## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++17 or later
- [SFML 3.0+](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

## 🚀 Build Instructions

### ✅ Option 1: Use the precompiled `.exe` (Windows only)

1. Just run SandSim.exe from executable folder.

### 🛠 Option 2: Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/masloorzech/SandSim.git
cd SandSim
```

Then build using CMakeList.txt

Make sure SFML is installed and linked properly.

## 📂 Project Structure

## 🧠 Inspiration
